JFP server
===========

A simple web app to store usage data from the [JFP Chrome extension](https://github.com/CarletonDevX/web-print). Looking for the password? It's in the code. Why is there even a password in the first place? Beats me. I think I was working from a tutorial.

To develop on this project, you'll need Flask: 
`pip install Flask`

Note: There's a commented-out section in the html template that'll let you manually add entries into the database for debugging purposes.
